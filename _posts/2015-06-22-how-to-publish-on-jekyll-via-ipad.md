title: how to publish to Jekyll via iPad or iPhone
--- 

All you need to publish on your Jekyll blog with your iDevice is to use Editorial app, the best app for bloggers together with Ulysses [^1]. 

Editorial allows you to create workflow to do a lots of things. **Max Jacobson** wrote a great one that allows you to publish on Github hosted Jekyll blog. You can find instruction on his blog  [hardscrabble](http://www.hardscrabble.net/2015/how-to-jekyll-from-ios/).

Just a brief note: if you published your blog as a project as I did, that is sigul.github.io/jekyll, than the repo to add in the workflow configuration is just /yourreponame, and not all the path to it. 

[^1]: Ulysess is definitely the best app a writer could desire, but when it comes to blogging it lacks an important feature: integrated browser.
