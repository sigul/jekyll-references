Hi, my name is Silvio. I wrote for years with Wordpress, Tumblr and Squarespace and now I want to migrate my writing to Jekyll. 

Essentially for one think: it let me stock all my writings in a single folder synced online. 

Sorry for my English, I am writing this blog more as a collection of note for myself then for people who will read it.
